Fundraising Efforts

Auryu Foundation is currently funded through a combination of private donations, product sales from our parent company (Auryu),
and strategic partnerships with aligned organizations. Our fundraising strategy focuses on building long-term relationships
with individual donors, corporate sponsors, and brand ambassadors who are deeply invested in purpose-driven impact.
